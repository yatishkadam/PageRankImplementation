Graph G1:

The number of pages with no in-links is 1
Thus over a corpus of 1000 pages there exists no page that has no in-link,
and hence the proportion of pages with no in-links in G1 is 1/1000 = 0.001

The number of pages with no-outlinks is 17 
Thus over a corpus of 1000 pages there exists 17 pages that has no out-link,
and hence the proportion of pages with no out-links in G1 is 17/1000 = 0.017

Graph G2:

The number of pages with no in-links is 14350
Thus over a corpus of 183,811 pages there exists 14350 pages that has no in-links,
and hence the proportion of pages with no in-links in G2 is 14350/183811 = 0.078069

The number of pages with no out-links is 66175
Thus over a corpus of 1000 pages there exists 66175 pages that has no out-links,
and hence the proportion of pages with no out-links in G2 is 66175/18381
