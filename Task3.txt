Task 3:

Graph G1:

The top 5 links obtained by PageRank are as follows:
	
->Integrated_Authority_File 0.0864524311615
->Electricity 0.0199161227996
->Germany 0.018658945769
->Africa 0.0166374216747
->Energy_policy 0.0123310617022	



Pages as per the  : In-link count

->Integrated_Authority_File 232
->United_States 191
->United_Kingdom 137
->National_Diet_Library 135
->Germany 127





Graph G2:

The top 5 links obtained by PageRank are as follows:		

->WT21-B37-76 0.00269447441555
->WT21-B37-75 0.0015331791
->WT25-B39-116 0.00146850141633
->WT23-B21-53 0.00137352493843
->WT24-B26-10 0.00127615674413

Page : In-link count
->WT21-B37-76: 2568
->WT21-B37-75: 1704 
->WT01-B18-225: 1137
->WT08-B19-222: 1041
->WT08-B18-400: 990

From the above examples,of G1 we see that
-> only 2 of the top 5 pages obtained by counting the number of in-links match the list of top 5 pages obtained by calculating the pagerank.

This is because PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the webpage is.
 The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites

The page "Electricity" in G1 is at the 2nd position when ranked according to the pagerank values, 
but it doesn't occur anywhere near the top 5 when checked for the number of inlinks it has. 
The reason is that though the page may contain less number of inlinks, it has popular/quality links 
pointing to it, that is , the pagerank of the links are high or good. 
On the other hand a page may have very large inlink count, but all these inlinks may not be popular and
thus will be low pagerank scores.

A hyperlink to a page counts as a vote of support.
The PageRank of a page is defined recursively and depends on the number and PageRank metric of all pages that link to it


It wouldn't be wrong to say that the pagerank of a page is directly proportional to that of its in-links.
And this why ranks of the same page may vary when ranked according to pagerank and by the number of in-links.
